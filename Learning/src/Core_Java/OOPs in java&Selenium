1. Abstraction:
	- Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features to user
	 EX-1 : There is WebDriver interface in selenium, which is implemented by ChromeDriver/FirefoxDriver classes,
			when we use driver.get() or driver.findElement() methods, the implementation behind these methods are hidden.
	 EX-2 : We call the  methods to perform an action in a test case but the actual implementation of the method is hidden. like click button, drag & Drop
	 
	 Uses : Readability, reusability, reduce code complexity
	
2. Encapsulation : 
	- Encapsulation is an object-oriented programming principle that means binding data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class), 
		and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
			- Prevents outside classes from modifying internal state directly
		EX : 1. wrap WebElements and actions like click inside page classes 
			 2. private driver instance and public setup(),tearDown() methods in BaseClass.

3. Polymorphism : 
	- Compile time polymorphism (Method overloading)- same method name but different parameters(either no.of parameters or datatype of parameters)
	- Run time polymorphism (Method overriding)- same method name but overrides the implementation of parent calss
	EX : 1. Implementing ITestListener & overriding the methods like onTestSuccess, onTestFailure and giving our own method body(taking ss/ printing some msg)
		 2. let's say have to create 2 login methods one for user & one for admin then method name Login is same but parameters are different in the same class (Compile time polymorphism)
		 
		 Uses : Readability, reusability, reduce code complexity

4. Inheritance : 
	- inheriting the properties and methods of parent class by using extends keyword
	EX : Let's say we have BaseClass for browser invoking & teardown, all test classes can inherit this base class for browser invoking and teardown.
	
	uses : reusability
	- Java won't support multiple inheritance i.e.,Class C extends B,A.
	What's the out put of below code:
	
	Class A{
		int i=10;
	}
	
	Class B extends A{
		int i=20;
	}
	Class Main{
		public static void main(String[] args){
			A a = new B();
			System.out.println(a.i);	// prints 10
			
			
			B a = new B();
			System.out.println(a.i);	// prints 20
		}
	}
